Instructions related to install controllers are placed into directory named "Installation Instructions".


Environment.py - Environment Module for setting up the environment. Subclasses for controller specific environment are following:
		1. RyuEnvironment.py 
		2. FreneticEnvironment.py 
		3. PyreticEnvironment.py 
		4. KineticEnvironment.py 
		5. FloodLightEnvironment.py 


Controller.py - This script is responsible for running and stopping a controllers. Some functionalities needs to be specified in subclasses. Some subclasses are following:

		1. RyuController.py
		2. FreneticController.py
		3. PyreticController.py
		4. KineticController.py
		5. FloodlightController.py


ApplicationRunner.py - This script is responsible for running and stopping an application. Some functionalities needs to be specified in subclasses. Some subclasses are following: 

		1. RyuApplicationRunner.py
		2. FreneticApplicationRunner.py
		3. PyreticApplicationRunner.py
		4. KineticApplicationRunner.py
		5. FloodlightApplicationRunner.py


Test.py - 	This script is responsible for running and collecting results for test cases such as number of flow-rules generated by controller. Some test cases are following:

		1. TestFlowrules.py  - Number of flow rules generated by controllers
		2. TestPacketIn.py - Number of packet_in and packet_out messages
		3. TestSwitchFlowrules.py - Number of rules in switch (queries switch every 100ms)


TestSuite.py - To create a Test Suite for running experiments. MacLearningSuite.py is subclass of it

config.ini - For specifying configuration such as controller ip and port, installation directory etc

RunSampleTest.py - This file is sort of client(main) file to run the experiment.



Some sample topologies files used in test bed are placed in "Topologies" directory
